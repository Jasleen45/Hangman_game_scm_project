# Hangman_game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a word letter by letter. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The player wins if they successfully guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. 

## How to Play

1. *Launch the Game*: Run the Python script hangman_game.py to start the game.
2. *Guessing Letters*: Click on the letters displayed on the screen to guess them.
3. *Winning and Losing*: 
   - If you correctly guess all the letters in the word, you win.

4. *Score*: Your score increases each time you win a game.
